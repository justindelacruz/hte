    section_1:
        title: Die Casting
        body: >
                HTE specializes in providing world-class quality products via Cold Chamber Die Castings, which is the
                manufacturing process of injecting premeasured amounts of molten metal (typically non-ferrous alloys) at
                high pressures into a hardened and reusable die, which can be designed to produce intricate shapes with
                high degrees of accuracy and repeatability of up to approximately 80,000 cycles/die. Once the molten metal
                has been injected, it rapidly solidifies under pressure into its desired form.<br>
                <br>
                The Die Casting process typically begins with a higher capital costs for the initial die but becomes one
                of the most economical casting processes at large production volumes. Die Casting is also known for its
                smooth cast surfaces, high degree of design complexity, and rapid production rates.
    section_2:
        title: Permanent Mold Casting
        body: >
                HTE specializes in providing world-class quality products via Gravity Permanent Mold Castings, which is the
                manufacturing process of pouring molten metal (typically non-ferrous) into permanent reusable molds that
                are typically made from materials with high thermal fatigue resistance. The molds are first typically
                preheated, mold-washed, and installed with metal or sand cores before the molten metal is poured in. The
                molds are then clamped shut until the molten metal cools and solidifies into its desired shape.<br>
                <br>
                The Permanent Mold process is known for its good surface finishes and dimensional accuracy. Although the
                mold costs are relatively high, their longevity coupled with the process’ high production rate make this
                method suitable for high production volumes.
    section_3:
        title: Sand Casting
        body: >
                HTE specializes in providing world-class quality products via Green Sand Castings, which is the
                manufacturing process of compacting moist refractory sand around a desired pattern, forming the cast
                product’s expendable mold cavity. Cores can be added for further intricacy if required. Sand Casting, due
                to the mold’s refractory nature, is capable of casting both ferrous and non-ferrous products.<br>
                <br>
                The Green Sand Casting process is relatively inexpensive and has few limitations in regards to its size or
                shape. However, Sand Casting results in coarse finishes and dimensional accuracy, thus additional finishing
                is often required. Sand Casting is most economical at low production rates.
    section_4:
        title: Investment Casting
        body: >
                HTE specializes in providing world-class quality products via Lost Wax Investment Castings, which is the
                manufacturing process of first utilizing a wax pattern that is casted or machined into the product’s
                geometry, and then coated with a refractory ceramic material. The coating is then baked, hardening into
                a shell while also subsequently melting away the inner wax, leaving an expendable mold cavity in the
                desired geometry for the molten metal to be poured into. Once the molten metal solidifies, the casting is
                extracted by breaking open the ceramic mold.<br>
                <br>
                Investment Casting is a relatively expensive process that requires skilled labor; however, the process
                produces highly intricate shapes with good dimensional accuracy and smooth surface finishes, leaving low
                finishing costs. Due to the molds refractory nature, it can cast both ferrous and non-ferrous metals.
    section_5:
        title: Die Drop Forging
        body: >
                HTE specializes in providing world-class quality products via Impression-Die Drop Forgings, which is the
                manufacturing process of utilizing specifically shaped dies attached to the hammer and anvil. The hammer is
                dropped onto the working metal (typically ferrous alloys), forcing the metal to flow into the dies’ desired
                cavities until fully formed.<br>
                <br>
                Impression-Die Drop Forging has a high initial capital cost due to the price of the dies, but has a low
                recurring cost, making the process most economical in high volumes. Forging finishes leave the material
                with a high strength-to-weight ratio due to the wrought effects of the metal working process.

    section_4:
        title: Heat Treatments
        body: >
                Depending on the product’s intended application and machining requirements, it may be necessary to alter
                the physical and mechanical properties of the material at hand. This can be completed through the
                application of heat treatment, which is the heating and subsequent cooling of a material in a controlled
                and specific manner without changing its exterior shape. Heat treatment has a myriad of benefits,
                including: improved strength, ductility, machinability, corrosion resistance, abrasion resistance, and
                electrical conductivity.<br>

    section_5:
        title: Surface Finishes
        body: >
                In today’s fast-paced world, first impressions can break or make a product’s success. To accomplish the
                latter, surface finishes are often applied to boost a final product’s aesthetic allure. Additionally, the
                benefits of surface finishes extend far deeper than just a product’s appearances but its functional
                application as well (e.g. corrosion resistance)<br>
                <br>
                At HTE Enterprise, we offer a wide range of surface finishes that include but are not limited to:
